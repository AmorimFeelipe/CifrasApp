        Dm  Bb  F  C

[Riff 1]

[Primera Parte]

Dm          Bb               F           C
   Do you know what's worth fighting for
Dm            Bb        F         C
   When it's not worth dying for?
Dm          Bb         F         C
   Does it take your breath away
         Bb                 C
And you feel yourself suffocating?

[Riff 1]

Dm           Bb         F         C
   Does the pain weight out the pride?
Dm          Bb          F       C
   And you look for a place to hide?
Dm         Bb              F       C
   Did someone break your heart inside?
           Bb   C5
You're in ruins

Give up the fight

One, twenty one guns
   C5         Bb5  F5           C5 (Riff 2)

You and I

[Segunda Parte]

[Riff 1]

Dm             Bb     F           C
   When you're at the end of the road
Dm          Bb       F               C
   And you lost all sense of control
Dm            Bb           F
   And your thoughts have taken their
  C
toll
           Bb
When your mind breaks the spirit of your
 C
soul

Dm       Bb              F      C
   Your faith walks on broken glass
Dm          Bb       F       C
   And the hangover doesn't pass
Dm           Bb     F       C
   Nothing's ever built to last
           Bb   C5
You're in ruins

You and I

[Tercera Parte]

[Riff 3]

D5           Bb5   F5          C5
   Did you try to live on your own
D5           Bb5             F5        A5
   When you burned down the house and home?
D5          Bb5        F5          A5
   Did you stand too close to the fire?
        Bb5
Like a liar looking for
    C5
Forgiveness from a stone

   And you can't get another try

[Riff 1]
